	<p>It was a warm Monday morning. Class started at 9am as usual. 
	We took the morning to go over our code and make a few changes if needed.
	After lunch, Sean walked us through creating an EC2 instance as a class. It took the 
	rest of the afternoon to get everyone up and running. Now we're ready to present tomorrow.</p>
