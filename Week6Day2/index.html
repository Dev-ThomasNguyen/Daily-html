		<h1>Week 6 / Day 2</h1>

			<h4>Dear diary,</h4>
				<p>Its presentation day! The time has come for everyone to show their amazing projects, but
					before we do so, we spent the morning prepping, reviewing, making final adjustments before
					updating the EC2 instance. Saw some inspirational projects that simply slapped me across the
					face and told me to do better. This one quote from this audible <i>The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide</i> by John Sonmez really got ingrained into my brain. "If you're going 
					to join a coding bootcamp, you have to climb to the top 10%" and golly jeez I will do my best.
				</p>
			<h5>Conclusion</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Study</li>
					<li>Practice/Experiment</li>
					<li>Repeat</li>
				</ul>
